#### Hello Reelit Team.

#### How I first designed how the system would work:

I have built a few websites now that utilise json and buttons. For this task I did not really plan the task. I instantly new that I can import a button from bootstrap and use CSS flexbox to justify and align the button into the middle of the body of the webpage as long as I set the body to viewport height and viewport width.  Sending an array via a python list is something I am very comfortable with aswell. So I mapped it out in my head. I knew if I get stuck that I have the code available for my old website that I can refer to. On bigger tasks I may write pseudo code. I have also completed wireframes and ERD's for bigger websites.

#### What sources I used to repurpose:

I have built myself a website template that is built in an MVC pattern that I have stored on my personal computer. I am refining the website template more and more every project. So you could call that a repurpose website template. You can check the source code at https://github.com/ScottBurleighHeads/Website_template. Also I rely on bootstrap with a bit of CSS for designing user interfaces. I am sure you guys are aware of bootstrap already but if not it is a source for pre-built CSS and Javascript.
